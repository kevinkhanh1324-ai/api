# Violence Prediction System In Real-Time


This project is a real-time violence prediction system powered by YOLOv8 and wrapped in a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard. It enables fast, accurate detection of violent behavior in video feeds and provides interactive tools for visual analytics, system monitoring, and parameter tuning.



## Features
🎥 Real-Time Detection: Detect violent actions (e.g., fights, assaults) in live webcam or video files using YOLOv8.

🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard: Intuitive web-based interface for video input, monitoring, and analytics.

⏩ Frame Skipping: Optimize performance by skipping video frames without compromising detection accuracy.

📊 Data Analytics & Visualization: View detection statistics, frame-wise logs, and visual trends in real-time.

🛠️ Adjustable Confidence Threshold: Tune detection sensitivity dynamically through the dashboard.

📈 System Resource Monitoring: Track CPU, memory, and GPU (if available) usage to manage performance efficiently.

📁 Logs & Reporting: Maintain logs of detected events with timestamps and video metadata.
